# Airbnb-price-prediction

Airbnb provides a platform for hosts to accommodate guests with short-term lodging and tourism-related activities. Guests can search for lodging using filters such as lodging type, dates, location, and price, and can search for specific types of homes, such as bed and breakfasts, unique homes, and vacation homes. Before booking, users must provide personal and payment information.Some hosts also require a scan of government-issued identification before accepting a reservation.Guests can chat with hosts through a secure messaging system. Hosts provide prices and other details for their rental or event listings, such as the allowed number of guests, home type, rules, and amenities. Hosts and guests have the ability to leave reviews about the experience.

So given the Airbnb data , a predictive model is built to predict the prices. 
On interpreting the model one can have a brief idea of what factors are contributing to the higher prices or lower prices and thus based on this further steps could be taken to improve the customer experience 
and futher make decisions to propel business to profits
